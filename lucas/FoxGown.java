/**
 * 
 * Ball Gown Fitting
 * The woodland creatures have created a beautiful ball gown for a
 *  local princess. Some of the foxes want to try on the ball gown 
 * to test it out before handing it over to the princess. 
 * The ball gown, which has a length S (1 <= S <= 1,000,000), is able 
 * to fit exactly two foxes. There are N foxes (2 <= N <= 100,000)
 * that are numbered from 1...N. 
 * Fox i has a length of L_i (1 <= L_i <= 1,000,000). Two foxes can
 * successfully try out the ball gown if their total length is not
 * longer than the gownâ€™s length. Find out how many pairs of distinct 
 * foxes can fit into the ball gown. 
 * INPUT FORMAT
 * Line 1: Two integers separated by a space: N and S
 * Line 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains a single integer: L_i
 * OUTPUT FORMAT
 * Line 1: A single integer representing the number of pairs of foxes that
 * can fit into the ball gown. The order of the two foxes does not matter.
